~ Desktop Cleaner ~

1. What should this program do?
    This program should automatically sort the files on your Desktop into predetermined folders.
2. How will it achieve this?
    To start, we will create folders for a defined list of file extensions. Then we will loop through the
    files on our desktop and put them into their designated folder.
3. How can we expand on this?
    * Add a GUI 
    * Allow for folders to be sorted as well as files
    * Create custom sorting conditions beyond file extensions

    # Define list of extensions that we'll be sorting

    # Loop through and create a file for each extension (if one doesn't exist already)

    # Loop through files on desktop and put them into their respective folders
